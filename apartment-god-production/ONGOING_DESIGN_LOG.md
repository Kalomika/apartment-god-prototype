# Apartment God Ongoing Design Log

Purpose: dated work history for Apartment God. The handbook is the standing rulebook. This log is where every meaningful change, fix, plan, revert, blocker, and test note gets appended.

## 2026-07-08 04:50 AM CT, Runtime Branch Handbook and Backup Policy Added

Status: IMPLEMENTED
Branch: phaser-migration
Commit: handbook 8abe2e4e368cb174b2d5f6d7782db0f1a2cfbaed, backup policy ac170678db2118322510f6ee40d352575e79e99b
Files changed: docs/APARTMENT_GOD_DEVELOPMENT_HANDBOOK.md, docs/APARTMENT_GOD_BACKUP_POLICY.md, apartment-god-production/ONGOING_DESIGN_LOG.md
Runtime files changed: no
Render playable branch updated: no
Backup branch: backup/phaser-migration-before-autonomy-upgrade-2026-07-08

Summary:
Created the runtime branch development handbook and backup retention policy so future AIs can use repo documents instead of relying only on limited GPT project instructions.

Implementation details:
The handbook defines project identity, branch rules, Render test link, logging rules, backup rules, priority order, runtime safety standards, mobile rules, gameplay rules, actor AI direction, movement direction, sleep and routine direction, thought bubble versus speech bubble rules, activity consequence direction, vocation direction, repo map, and developer behavior standards.

The backup policy defines routine backups, protected milestone backups, a 5 routine backup retention rule per major work stream, and special rules before updating main for Render access.

Testing performed:
Documentation only. No runtime test needed.

Testing requested:
None for documentation.

Known risks:
The handbook and log need to stay synchronized across major branches if future agents work outside phaser-migration.

Follow ups:
Upgrade autonomy and movement choice behavior so actors stop wandering to pointless places, use alternate objects, vary activities, and remain functional without Kam directing every action.

## 2026-07-08 04:55 AM CT, Current Autonomy Upgrade Request

Status: PLANNED
Branch: phaser-migration
Commit: pending
Files changed: pending
Runtime files changed: planned
Render playable branch updated: no
Backup branch: backup/phaser-migration-before-autonomy-upgrade-2026-07-08

Summary:
Kam reset the game and observed that the actors still behave too stupidly. Current priority is upgrading the active actor autonomy so characters function at the highest reasonable capability under the current Canvas game engine.

Implementation details:
Requested autonomy direction:

- Actors should use the whole house intelligently without needing Kam to direct every action.
- Auto mode should not be the only trigger for autonomy. Characters should generally be automatic, with guided/player commands overriding when needed for testing.
- Actors should satisfy needs, shower, eat, sleep, use bathrooms, use objects, do social actions, kiss, cuddle, interact with the dog, choose fun activities, and rotate through available activities before repeating too much.
- Actors should avoid pointless wandering to places with no activity, such as the front porch, unless there is an actual reason like food delivery, package, visitor, or future dog bone/object.
- Dog should not repeatedly go to front porch unless a real dog activity exists there.
- If an object is occupied or blocked, actors should try alternate objects or alternate rooms before giving up.
- Downstairs bathroom and upstairs bathroom should be interchangeable options when appropriate.
- Characters should not stand blocked in the middle of a room if another path, object, or fallback exists.
- Movement should use route variation and different approach points over time.
- Long activities should be interruptible by urgent needs or work.
- Movies, shows, music, reading, exercise, coffee, jobs, work schedules, vocation systems, thought bubbles, speech bubbles, and long term consequences are desired future systems. Implement current autonomy first without overbuilding the future systems prematurely.

Testing performed:
Not implemented yet.

Testing requested:
After implementation, test Reset, idle autonomy, bathroom fallback, dog behavior, fun activity choice, sleep, and guided interruption.

Known risks:
Autonomy touches core runtime behavior and can easily make the game feel worse if it spams actions, interrupts too aggressively, or fights guided commands.

Follow ups:
Implement autonomy upgrade carefully on phaser-migration, then mirror main only when Kam needs Render browser testing.
